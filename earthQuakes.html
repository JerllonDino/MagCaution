							<h4>Earthquakes</h4>

						<div class="panel-body">
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">An earthquake is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the breaking and shifting of subterranean rock as it releases strain that has accumulated over a long time. Initial mild shaking may strengthen and become extremely violent within seconds. Additional earthquakes, called aftershocks, may follow the initial earthquake. Most are smaller than the initial earthquake but larger magnitude aftershocks also occur.  Earthquakes may cause household items to become dangerous projectiles; cause buildings to move off foundations or collapse, damage utilities, roads and structures such as bridges and dams, or cause fires and explosions. They may also trigger landslides, avalanches, and tsunamis.</p>

							<h4>What To Do?</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">
							<center><h3>Before An Earthquake</h3></center>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">Before an earthquake occurs, secure items that could fall or move and cause injuries or damage (e.g., bookshelves, mirrors, light fixtures, televisions, computers, hot water heaters. Move beds away from windows and secure any hanging items over beds, couches, cribs or other places people sit or lie.</p>
							<h3>Practice how to “Drop, Cover, and Hold On!”</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">Plan and practice how to Drop to the ground, Cover your head and neck with your arms, and if a safer place is nearby that you can get to without exposing yourself to flying debris, crawl to it and Hold On to maintain cover.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">To react quickly you must practice often. You may only have seconds to protect yourself in an earthquake.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">Electricity, water, gas and telephones may not be working after an earthquake. The police and fire departments are likely to be tied up. You should be prepared to fend for yourself for at least three days, preferably for a week. </p>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-indent: 50px">You'll need food and water (a gallon a day per person); a first aid kit; a fire extinguisher suitable for all types of fires; flashlights; a portable radio; extra batteries, blankets, clothes, shoes and money (ATMs may not work); medication; an adjustable or pipe wrench to turn off gas or water, if necessary; baby and pet food; and an alternate cooking source (barbecue or camp stove). This list can also be applied to other disasters, such as floods or wildfires. </p>
