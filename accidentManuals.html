                    <h5>Overtaking other vehicles can be dangerous. The difficulty with overtaking is judging the space required to complete the manoeuvre safely.</h5>
                  </center>
                  <p>Both single lane and multi-lane overtaking manoeuvres involve risk and require extreme care. If you have any doubts it is best not to overtake and to wait until it is safer.</p>
                  <p>You must overtake on the right unless a vehicle is waiting to turn right, is stationary, or if you and the other vehicle are travelling in marked lanes. In these instances you may overtake on the left side if it is safe.</p>
                  <h5>When overtaking you must:</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><h6>Not go over the speed limit</h6></li>
                    <li><h6>Make sure the road ahead is clear and that there is sufficient space for you to complete the manoeuvre (check side streets and other lanes to ensure nothing will enter this space while you are overtaking)</h6></li>
                    <li><h6>Check mirrors</li>
                      <li><h6>Signal each change in position long enough to give sufficient warning to others</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Check blind spots for motorcycles and other vehicles before changing your lane position</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Pass the vehicle with sufficient space to avoid a collision (you should be able to see the vehicle you have overtaken in your rear vision mirror before you move in front of it)</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Give way to traffic already in the lane you are moving to.</h6></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>When overtaking you must:</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li><h6>Unless you have a clear view of any approaching traffic and you can complete the manoeuvre safely (do not commence an overtaking manoeuvre when approaching a crest, curve or any limited vision situation)</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Another vehicle that is stopping or has stopped at a pedestrian crossing, intersection or railway crossing</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Across an unbroken (continuous) line, unless the line closest to you is broken</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Where a road narrows.</h6></li>

                    </ul>
                    <h5>When overtaking you must:</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li><h6>Keep left and allow reasonable space for the overtaking vehicle to pass and move back into the lane</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Not increase your speed</h6></li>
                      <li><h6>Keep within your lane.</h6></li>
                    </ul>

                    <center><h4>What To Do?</h4>
                      <h3>Before An Earthquake</h3></center>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Before an earthquake occurs, secure items that could fall or move and cause injuries or damage (e.g., bookshelves, mirrors, light fixtures, televisions, computers, hot water heaters. Move beds away from windows and secure any hanging items over beds, couches, cribs or other places people sit or lie.</li>
                        <li><h4>Practice how to “Drop, Cover, and Hold On!”</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Plan and practice how to Drop to the ground, Cover your head and neck with your arms, and if a safer place is nearby that you can get to without exposing yourself to flying debris, crawl to it and Hold On to maintain cover.</li>
                          <li>To react quickly you must practice often. You may only have seconds to protect yourself in an earthquake.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Electricity, water, gas and telephones may not be working after an earthquake. The police and fire departments are likely to be tied up. You should be prepared to fend for yourself for at least three days, preferably for a week.</li>
                        <li>You'll need food and water (a gallon a day per person); a first aid kit; a fire extinguisher suitable for all types of fires; flashlights; a portable radio; extra batteries, blankets, clothes, shoes and money (ATMs may not work); medication; an adjustable or pipe wrench to turn off gas or water, if necessary; baby and pet food; and an alternate cooking source (barbecue or camp stove). This list can also be applied to other disasters, such as floods or wildfires.</li>

                    <p>An earthquake is the sudden, rapid shaking of the earth, caused by the breaking and shifting of subterranean rock as it releases strain that has accumulated over a long time. Initial mild shaking may strengthen and become extremely violent within seconds. Additional earthquakes, called aftershocks, may follow the initial earthquake. Most are smaller than the initial earthquake but larger magnitude aftershocks also occur.  Earthquakes may cause household items to become dangerous projectiles; cause buildings to move off foundations or collapse, damage utilities, roads and structures such as bridges and dams, or cause fires and explosions. They may also trigger landslides, avalanches, and tsunamis.</p>
